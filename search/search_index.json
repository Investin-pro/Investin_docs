Make investment \u00b6 Investors are required to interact with the router contract and give approval of the base token with which they would like to invest in any fund. After the approval investors can proceed to call the make investment function which mints an ERC 721 token and send it to the caller's address while transferring the said amount of approved tokens to the router.

Beware the loss of access to the address holding IVNT token can result to loss of investment as contracts are hardcoded and only recognize investors through these non-fungible tokens.

Without users any protocol is worthless and IVN token represents ownership in the protocol and is architectured in a way that as the protocol's total value under management grows, further it will be owned by managers running funds on it. Investin's most important stakeholders are its Managers/Traders Investin's growth is directly proportional to its user's success hence the tokeneconomics is deeply baked into making users the rightful owners of the protocol so that they can capture most value out of it. The protocol captures an average 1.4% of total value under management as a fee on each successful cycle of manager meeting their set return of investment and collecting performance fee. Hence manager's success in markets is directly proportional to the protocol's growth and to ensure the longevity of the relation, 50% of the total fee accrued by the protocol will be distributed among the managers based on meeting the minimum criteria and rest 50% to the development team to make sure both the parties move in a smooth linear growth. And as the growth accelerates there will be a tier-based reduction on fee distributed to developers and subsequent increment to the fee distributed to managers. Incentives \u00b6 The goal of any decentralize protocol is to ultimately give ownership to its users and incentivize them enough to align paths on producing maximum profitability for all parties involved. For managers/traders \u00b6 Managers/traders running funds on investin and staking IVN tokens will capture the 50% fee as elloborated below: Tokens staked Fee captured 100 20% 200 40% 400 60% 800 80% 1000 100% The managers should increase their staked tokens as the total fee collected by protocol increases, the rate of increment is fixed at a 50% increment rate to capture the same percentage of fee at each increment of 100% on total fee protocol makes. The value captured by ivn tokens will be diluted if managers don't increase their staked tokens. As discussed the fee will gradually increase for managers on a tier-based system which is determined by the total value generated by Investin's managers. Protocol earnings Managers Fee % Developers Fee% Fee used to burn tokens 100k 50% 50% 0% 200k 55% 40% 5% 400k 59% 32% 9% 800k 62.2% 25.6% 12.2% 1m 64.76% 20.48% 14.76% 2m 66.76% 16.38% 16.76% The dev team has decided to use 20% of profits accrued from developer fee% to buy back IVN tokens and burn to further align goals with protocol growth. Incase the managers don't stake to capture the total fee, the fee will be used to by back IVN and burn. The burning will stop when 50% of tokens are burnt and in subsequent phase the fee would be added to managers earning pool. Additional incentives are planned to be given to managers handling top performing funds, funds with high aum, funds with greater than 100 investors and much more... For Investors \u00b6 Investin's key liquidity providers are expected to actively engage with protocol to find the best performing fund for their investment and get a 50% reduction on holding IVN token in their wallet while they are invested in Investin funds. The ivn holdings to get 50% fee reduction in management fee is elaborated below. The investors are expected to increase their ivn holdings to get the same benefits at each increment in fee captured by the protocol. Fees captured IVN holding 100k 100 200k 200 800k 400 1m 800 2m 1200 The investors will be airdropped IVN for certain criteria's and are expected to be protected from maximum drawdowns in highly, unlike scenarios which will be covered by the treasury which is locked to safeguard investin's key liquidity providers interests. 10% of IVN are locked as insurance for investor funds and as the total value under management grows this treasury will be replenished with a basket of different assets to protect all user's interests. IVN allocation and sales \u00b6 A total supply of 9,000,000 IVN tokens are minted with no further minting planned in line with the current tokeneconomics structure. This can be changed with governance takeover as the future of decentralized protocols evolve. A total of 40% of tokens will be sold on ethereum and binance smart chain, we believe the future of decentralized protocol is to be multi-chain hence investin will distribute the fee collected over both chains equally among all users. The token sale is priced at 0.2 USD per token The seed was raised at 0.12 USD per token and is vested over 3 years with a 10% scheduled release every quarter Core team's tokens are vested for 4 years with 10% scheduled release every quarter. The advisory tokens are unallocated at the moment and once advisors are onboarded the tokens would be vested for 1 year. The treasury is used to incentivize users and make them part owners of Investin, there will be scheduled airdrops to top performing funds, funds managing high aum consistently and to investors committed to building investin. In rare cases of manager duping fund performance, the treasury will be used to compensate investor losses. Fund usage \u00b6 50% of the funds will be used to build the Investin protocol and perform upgrades to the existing architecture/UI, which includes team recruits and R&D on layer 2 solutions. 35% will be used to perform security upgrades and bug bounties. Investin being fund management protocol have to put fund security as its top priority. 15% will be kept in reserve to cope with any emergency or unexpected situations Governance \u00b6 We believe alignment between token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance. More explicitly, we believe IVN tokens are the vehicle to drive alignment and participation in the protocol. IVN token holders should be people who interact with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table. We expect token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation. For example, implementing new functionality, deploying the protocol on additional smart contract blockchains beyond Ethereum, using layer 2 solutions for scaling, introducing changes to protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the IVN token holders for review Deepdive economics \u00b6 Deflationary value explained \u00b6","title":"Tokeneconomics"},{"location":"token/#investin-token-ivn","text":"","title":"Investin Token (IVN)"},{"location":"token/#overview","text":"IVN is an ERC 20 token built on OpenZeppelin standards, its native token of the protocol which will be used both to capture value from the protocol and allow holders to participate in governance.
