## Types of Funds
 
### Swap Funds
Lightweight funds with swapping capabilites built on amm's with deep liquidity. These funds are coded very efficeiently and the gas costs to deposit/withdraw and trade are the cheapest. These funds can be used by DAO's to manage treasury in a non custodial manner, communities to manage funds collectlively and individual traders with good expereince in markets.

Multi sig adapters can be built to manage funds by voting to take allocation in assets by collective investors rather than a single manager/trader


### Defi Hedge Funds
Highly adaptable funds with capabilites to integerate almost any on-chain protocol to generate profits, Investin's unique architecture allows to build custom strategy contracts that use multiple on chain protocols to capture best yeilds. 

Through these strategy adapters Investin funds are able to interact with multiple protocols allowing them to take part in almost all DeFi activites by tokenizing positions. These strategy contracts take positions in various protocols and issue ERC 20 tokens that represent a funds positsion in certain strategy. All strategy contracts are independent of each other hence failure in one of the partner protocols wont effect all of Investin, only the funds that have investment in such strategy will be effected. 


#### ETF's 

### Investor stoploss
