# Overview

Investin is the first Decentralized Fund Management protocol live on Solana and BSC that transforms aspiring traders into Fund Managers by providing them a turstless and non-custodial platform as a service for active management of capital. This enables investors to earn passive returns on the capital invested in the funds whilst retaining the custody of their assets all along. 

# On-chain visibility

 The trading history, positions, active Assets Under Management (AUM) and returns performance of Investin's Funds are always transparent. Investors are empowered to make an informed decision before investing, withdrawaing or staying invested in a particular fund by having access to real-time and historical on-chain data. 

 Fund Managers who showcase consistent perfomance on Investin and outperform other managers in the market, are able to access more capital to trade with, by attracting new investments and generating higher returns, enhancing the protocol's growth and user adoption.
