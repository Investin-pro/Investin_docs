# Overview

Investin is the first decentralized fund management protocol live on Solana and Binance Smart Chain that facilitates trustless interactions between prospecting Investors and aspiring traders. The protocol provides an open market for investors and traders to exchange their offerings in a trustless and non-custodial environment i.e. Investors keep custody of their assets at all times, while Managers make investment decisions and manage assets with the goal of producing a return for both parties.

# On-chain visibility

 The trading history, positions, and Assets Under Management (AUM) of Investin Fund Managers are always transparent to Investors. Investor decision making about joining, leaving, or staying with a particular fund is informed by having access to real-time and historical on-chain data. 

 Fund Managers cannot hide their positions, performance canâ€™t be faked, and any deviations from a funds investment strategy are visible to investors straight away. For example, if a Manager is highly leveraged beyond their advertised strategy, an investor is able to remove themselves from that strategy by exiting the fund. Fund Managers who show an expected perfomance can build a community using their reputation and history on Investin. This can only help in increasing inflows of new liquidity from Investors.
