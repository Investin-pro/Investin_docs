## Types of Funds
 
### Investment Funds
Lightweight funds with swapping capabilites built on amm's with deep liquidity. These funds are coded very efficeiently and the gas costs to deposit/withdraw and trade are the cheapest in the industry. These funds can be used by DAO's to manage treasury in a non custodial manner, communities to manage funds collectlively and individual traders with good expereince in markets.



### Defi Hedge Funds
Highly adaptable funds with capabilites to integerate almost any on-chain protocol to generate stable yeilds irrespective of market conditions, Investin's unique architecture allows to build custom strategy contracts that use multiple on chain protocols to capture best yeilds. 


#### Strategies 


The strategy adapter contracts allow Investin funds to interact with multiple protocols allowing them to take part in almost all DeFi activites by tokenizing positions. These strategy contracts take positions in various protocols and issue ERC 20 tokens that represent a funds position in certain strategies. All strategy contracts are independent of each other hence failure in one of the integerated protocols wont effect all Investin funds, only the funds that have investment in such strategy will be effected. We try our best on understanding all aspects of a protocol before integerating them but `Investin does not take any responsibility if the integerated protocols are compromised`. 

1. The farming strategies are autocompounded at the cheapest fee in the industry, at a fee of 0.1% of yeild generated.
2. Users without a fund can also take advantage of autocompounding farms
3. Custom strategies can be added that generate stable yeilds with no downside risk 
4. Margin trading protocols can be integerated allowing managers to hedge positions in downside markets

### Dynamic performance 

Fund managers can collect the performance fee on the investments for which the minimum returns is reached. The dashboard will show the relevent fee the manager can collect, `the fee that is to be collected should be in the base token of the fund`. This feature incentivizes managers to set short term protfitboiltu goals and earn fee on meeting the profit targets. This feature compliments to investor stoploss.
