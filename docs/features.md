## Types of Funds
 
### Investment Funds
Lightweight funds with swapping capabilities built on AMM's with deep liquidity. These funds are coded very efficiently and the gas costs to deposit/withdraw and trade are the cheapest in the industry. These funds can be used by DAO's to manage treasury in a non-custodial manner, communities to manage funds collectively and individual traders with good experience in markets.



### Defi Hedge Funds
Highly adaptable funds with capabilities to integrate almost any on-chain protocol to generate stable yields irrespective of market conditions, Investin's unique architecture allows building custom strategy contracts that use multiple on-chain protocols to capture the best yields. 


#### Strategies 


The strategy adapter contracts allow Investin funds to interact with multiple protocols allowing them to take part in almost all DeFi activities by tokenizing positions. These strategy contracts take positions in various protocols and issue ERC 20 tokens that represent a funds position in certain strategies. All strategy contracts are independent of each other hence failure in one of the integrated protocols won't affect all Investin funds, only the funds that have investment in such strategy will be affected. We try our best on understanding all aspects of a protocol before integrating them but `Investin does not take any responsibility if the integrated protocols are compromised`. 

1. The farming strategies are autocompounded at the cheapest fee in the industry, at a fee of 0.1% of yield generated.
2. Users without a fund can also take advantage of auto-compounding farms
3. Custom strategies can be added that generate stable yields with no downside risk 
4. Margin trading protocols can be integrated allowing managers to hedge positions in downside markets

### Dynamic performance 

Fund managers can collect the performance fee on the investments for which the minimum returns is reached. The dashboard will show the relevant fee the manager can collect, `the fee that is to be collected should be in the base token of the fund`. This feature incentivizes managers to set short term profitability goals and earn fees on meeting the profit targets. This feature compliments investor stop-loss.
