## Types of Funds
 
### Investment Funds
Lightweight funds capable of swapping tokens built on AMMs with deep liquidity. These funds were coded with utmost focus on efficieny and the costs to deposit/withdraw and trade are the cheapest in the industry. These funds are purpose built for individual traders with good experience in markets who aspire to start a public fund by themselves by showcasing the track record of their performance and can also be used by DAO's to manage treasury in a non-custodial manner or by communities to manage funds collectively.


### Defi Hedge Funds
Highly composable funds with capabilities to integrate almost any on-chain protocol to generate stable yields irrespective of market conditions. Investin's unique architecture integrates custom strategy contracts that utilize multiple on-chain protocols to capture the best possible yields. 


#### Strategies 


The strategy adapter contracts allow Investin funds to interact with multiple protocols allowing them to take part in almost all DeFi activities by tokenizing positions. These strategy contracts create positions in various protocols and issue ERC-20 tokens that represent a fund's share in respective strategies. All strategy contracts are independent of each other hence failure in one of the integrated protocols is limited to funds participating in affected strategies. We follow due deliginece while selecting protocols to integrate through our strategies but `Investin does not take any responsibility if the integrated protocols are compromised later`. 

1. The farming strategies are autocompounded at the cheapest fee in the industry, at a fee of 0.1% of yield generated.
2. Users without a fund can also take advantage of auto-compounding farms and other strategies.
3. Custom strategies can be added that generate stable yields with no downside risk .
4. Margin trading protocols can be integrated allowing managers to hedge positions in downside markets.

### Dynamic performance 

Fund managers can collect the performance fee accrued through investor withdrawals or choose to dynamically collect the impending fee on the live investments exceeding minimum returns regardless of any crystalization period or withdrawals. The dashboard displays the relevant fee collectable by the fund manager, `this amount must be available in the base token denomination of the fund`. This feature incentivizes managers to set short term profitability goals and collect performance fees on meeting the profit targets. This feature compliments investor stop-loss.
