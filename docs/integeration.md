Investin is built upon a highly composable architecture that integrates multiple DeFi protocols. This enables Managers with a wide range of DeFi strategies to be executed through their Funds such as token swaps, margin trades, options, lending, and liquidity mining (farming).


### Swap
=== "Solana"
    Enabling funds to trade in multiple tokens and fetch prices dynamically on-chain for accurate performance computation. Token swaps powered by:
    
    1. Raydium protocol: All tokens listed on Raydium can be traded through Investin Funds but to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the funds by listing and trading fake/valueless tokens we maintain an expandable token whitelist.
    2. Orca protocol: All tokens listed on Orca can be traded through Investin funds. Orca whitelists their trading pairs however Investin will further investigate before allowing them to be traded through Investin Funds. 
    3. Jupiter Aggregator: The leading liquidity aggregator on Solana powering Investin's swap engine to give best prices on every swap.
