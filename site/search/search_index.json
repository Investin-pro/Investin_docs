The protocol shall ensure both the users are well incentivized to conduct a trustless exchange of offerings, while managers are given access to almost all possible market activities with the fund assets, investors are provided with best in class UI with safety standards built-in to protect capital at all costs. Make investment \u00b6 Solana Investors are required to interact with the program and deposit in the base token of the fund, this amount is initially stored in the router vault under a PDA and an investor account is created to identify each investment, essentially making unique investment receipts to handle each investment. FundInstruction::InvestorDeposit { amount } The investor receipt allows Investin protocol to provide features like: Investor stoploss i.e. investors can define the percentage of profit or loss at which they want to withdraw. Enables fund PDA's to be composable since the receipt can be used as debt receipt for each investor account. EVM Investors are required to interact with the router contract and give approval of the base token with which they would like to invest in any fund. After the approval investors can proceed to call the make investment function which mints an ERC 721 token and send it to the caller's address while transferring the said amount of approved tokens to the router. We use a different approach at solving the fund management system by using the ERC 721 standard to identify investors on blockchain. function makeInvestment(uint amount) external returns(uint256) IVNy token \u00b6 IVNy is a non-fungible token based on OpenZeppelin's ERC 721 standard, this token is used as a confirmation receipt that all investors shall receive on a successful investment transaction. The token holds no value and is merely used to identify investors of a particular fund. Beware the loss of access to the address holding IVNy token can result to loss of investment as contracts are hardcoded and only recognize investors through these non-fungible tokens. Advantages of using nft: Once minted investor can use the same token in the wallet to interact with the protocol at almost 40% less gas expense since the protocol will know details about the investor, token acts as a marker. We plan to integrate lending feature for IVNy nft holders i.e. investors can borrow by staking their IVNy token as collateral. Assets can be added to existing allocation in any fund and partial assets can be withdrawn as well Performance \u00b6 The performance on invested amount can be queried on-chain and the smart contracts use on-chain amm pool reserves to calculate asset price hence the performance will be subject to an error \u00b12% but upon ending investment the asset evaluation done by contracts will be final and true to the exact decimal at all times. Blockchain is open by design and any investor can query the fund address to keep tabs on performance. Solana the fund is a program derived address(PDA) Solidity function getInvestmentDetails(uint tokenId) external view returns (uint128 investedAmount, uint128 startPerformance, uint128 currentPerformance, uint128 currentReturns) End Investment \u00b6 Solana This instruction can only be called by investor address and consists of multiple transactions to overcome the current limitation of 35 accounts and 200,000 compute limit per transaction. To achieve the composablilty into Investin's architecute we handle the withdrawal process in multiple steps in each step the specific updates on investor account(receipt) is handled. There is no lockup period investors remain in full control of funds and can deposit/withdraw at their convenience. Example flow: A fund having position in 4 assets that are swapped from Raydium and 2 margin positions open on mango markets is handled in the following transaction flows: The investor share is calculated on the total fund AUM. The assets owed by fund are accounted in this stage. The dues on fund assets are settled and sent to investor wallet address The borrows are settled on both margin positions and according to investors' share, the positions are closed. Is is important to note here that the health of margin account remains same, only the margin amount is changed. The dues on margin positions are settled by withdrawing from mango account and sending directly to investor address Solidity This function can only be called by investor's holding IVNy token and consists of two sub-functions which gives investor's the option to either collect 100% of their investment or make a partial withdrawal to book profits on invested amount. The investors have the option to recieve their investment according to fund allocation which is the cheapest option to withdraw or they can provide the token in which they would like to get their investment withdrawn from fund. There is no lockup period investors remain in full control of funds and can deposit/withdraw at their convenience. Fees \u00b6 Management fee A 2% upfront management fee is deducted on each successful investment out of which 1% is given to the manager who uses the fees to manage expenses of running the fund which includes transferring tokens to fund contract and calling swap functions to trade using amm's. The management fee won't be deducted if the investor withdraws their investment before the manager moves tokens to their fund contract. Performance fee The managers can only collect their performance fee if they reach the minimum return on investment they set, this minimum ROI is range bound and can be anywhere between 5-50%. If the manager makes less than the ROI they set, the investors won't be charged any performance fee and can withdraw at any time. This system of reaching minimum ROI thereby only encourages managers to make more profits and creates a positive feedback loop. Miscellaneous \u00b6 Investors can withdraw funds from the router without incurring any fee if the withdrawal is done before the manager moves tokens to fund contract There is a possibility investment made to a fund hasnt been moved to fund contract which means the investment will be in an inactive state and no performance made by the relevant fund will be reflected on such investment.

Without users any protocol is worthless and IVN token represents ownership in the protocol and designed to incentivize traders to start their funds and attract investments. Investin's most important stakeholders are its Managers/Traders Investin's growth is directly proportional to its user's success hence the tokeneconomics is deeply baked into making users the rightful owners of the protocol so that they can capture most value out of it. The protocol captures an average 1.4% of total value under management as a fee on each successful cycle of manager meeting their set return of investment and collecting performance fee. Hence manager's success in markets is directly proportional to the protocol's growth and to ensure the longevity of the relation, the total fee accrued by the protocol will be distributed among the managers who stake their IVN tokens Incentives for fund managers \u00b6 The goal of any decentralize protocol is to ultimately give ownership to its users and incentivize them enough to align paths on producing maximum profitability for all parties involved. Fee distribution \u00b6 Fund managers running funds on investin and staking IVN tokens will capture the accured protocol fee by staking IVN in staking contract which will mint IVNx tokens that represent their share in the fee distribution pool. You will come with less IVN tokens only to leave with more. Incase the manager's don't stake to capture the total fee, the fee will be used to buyback IVN and burn. The burning will stop when 50% of tokens are burnt and in subsequent phase the fee would be added to managers earning pool. Performance mining \u00b6 The performance mining program will distribute 500 IVN tokens everyday to encourage traders to start funds and attract more users to the protocol. The mining rewards are distributed based on the following scoring formula: \\[ Score(fund) = (\\frac{Perf_{fund}}{Perf_{max}}W_{perf}) + (\\frac{AUM_{fund}}{AUM_{max}}W_{aum}) + (\\frac{Nol_{fund}}{Nol_{fund}}W_{nol}) \\] Performance Assets under management Number of investors Perf max : highest fund performance relative to last epoch AUM max : highest AUM of fund Nol max : highest number of investor over all funds Perf fund : fund performance relative to last epoch AUM fund : current AUM of the fund Nol fund : current number of investors in the fund W perf : weightage assigned to performance W aum : weightage assigned to AUM W nol : weightage assigned to number of investors $$ W_{perf}: 60 points $$ $$ W_{aum}: 30 points $$ $$ W_{nol}: 10 points $$ As shown above the formula takes into consideration 3 parameters in a weighted manner i.e. Performance 60%, AUM 30% and Number fo investors 10% of fund to determine the score and fund managers qualifying above the minimum threshold will be airdropped IVN tokens per epoch, each epoch is of 7 days. For Investors \u00b6 Investin's key liquidity providers are expected to actively engage with protocol to find the best performing fund for their investment. The investors will be airdropped IVN for certain criteria's and in a highly unlike scenario where fund's hit maximum drawdown due to technical breakdown investors can expect the losses to be covered by the treasury which is locked to safeguard investin's key liquidity providers interests. 10% of IVN are locked as insurance for investor funds and as the total value under management grows this treasury will be replenished with a basket of different assets to protect all user's interests. Token Utility \u00b6 Investin token locked in the staking contract mints IVNx tokens which allows fund managers to unlock pro features all the while earning protocol fee: Limit/stoploss orders Access greater than 2x leverage on margin accounts Access to governance portal to vote and submit proposals IVN allocation and sales \u00b6 A total supply of 9,000,000 IVN tokens are minted with no further minting possible as the contract has no minting functionality. Since we dont have a significant backing we will be providing liquiidty for a indefinite time. The token sale was priced at 1 BNB = 2400 IVN.

Core team's tokens are vested for 3 years with 8% scheduled release every quarter. contract address The advisory tokens are unallocated at the moment and once advisors are onboarded the tokens would be vested for 1 year. The treasury is used to incentivize users and make them part owners of Investin, there will be scheduled airdrops to top performing funds, funds managing high aum consistently and to investors committed to building investin. In rare cases when a white-listed token gets hacked and fund performance crashes, the treasury will be used to compensate investor losses as it's investin's job to maintain rug proof tokens white listed that funds can trade on. Fund usage \u00b6 50% of the funds will be used to build the Investin protocol and perform upgrades to the existing architecture/UI, which includes team recruits and R&D on layer 2 solutions. 35% will be used to perform security upgrades and bug bounties. Investin being fund management protocol have to put fund security as its top priority. 15% will be kept in reserve to cope with any emergency or unexpected situations Governance \u00b6 We believe alignment between token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance. More explicitly, we believe IVN tokens are the vehicle to drive alignment and participation in the protocol. IVN token holders should be people who interact with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table. We expect token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation. For example, implementing new functionality, introducing changes to protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the IVN token holders for review.
