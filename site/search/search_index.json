The token holds no value and is merely used to identify investors of a particular fund. Beware the loss of access to the address holding IVNy token can result to loss of investment as contracts are hardcoded and only recognize investors through these non-fungible tokens. Advantages of using nft: Once minted investor can use the same token in the wallet to interact with the protocol at almost 40% less gas expense since the protocol will know details about the investor, token acts as a marker.

Minimum amount This refers to minimum investable amount that an investor can invest in the fund. The manager can set this according to their criteria of investment strategy to attract their niche level of investors. Minimum return The manager can set the minimum returns they will be targetting before collecting the performance fee on the profits made on the fund. The higher its set the better. This paramater once set cannot be changed and the contract will allow manager to collect there fee only when the minimum return criteria is met.

Without users any protocol is worthless and IVN token represents ownership in the protocol and is architectured in a way that as the protocol's total value under management grows, further it will be owned by managers running funds on it. Investin's most important stakeholders are its Managers/Traders Investin's growth is directly proportional to its user's success hence the tokeneconomics is deeply baked into making users the rightful owners of the protocol so that they can capture most value out of it. The protocol captures an average 1.4% of total value under management as a fee on each successful cycle of manager meeting their set return of investment and collecting performance fee. Hence manager's success in markets is directly proportional to the protocol's growth and to ensure the longevity of the relation, the total fee accrued by the protocol will be distributed among the managers and developers with a gradual_decrease in developer share as fee earned by protocol increases to make sure both the parties move in a smooth linear growth. Incentives \u00b6 The goal of any decentralize protocol is to ultimately give ownership to its users and incentivize them enough to align paths on producing maximum profitability for all parties involved. For managers/traders \u00b6 Managers/traders running funds on investin and staking IVN tokens will capture the accured fee earned by staking IVN in staking contract which will mint IVNx tokens that represent their share in the fee distribution pool. You will come with less IVN tokens only to leave with more. The fee distribution to manager pool will gradually increase on a tier-based system which is determined by the total value generated by Investin's managers. Protocol earnings Managers Fee % Developers Fee% Fee used to burn tokens 100k 50% 50% 0% 400k 55% 42.5% 2.5% 800k 59% 36% 4% 1.6m 62.2% 31.7% 6.1% 6.4m 64.76% 27.86% 7.38% 25.6m 66.76% 24.76% 8.38% The dev team has decided to use 20% of profits accrued from developer fee% to buyback IVN tokens and burn to further align goals with protocol growth. Incase the manager's don't stake to capture the total fee, the fee will be used to buyback IVN and burn. The burning will stop when 50% of tokens are burnt and in subsequent phase the fee would be added to managers earning pool. Additional incentives are planned to be given to managers handling top performing funds, funds with high aum, funds with greater than 100 investors and much more... For Investors \u00b6 Investin's key liquidity providers are expected to actively engage with protocol to find the best performing fund for their investment. The investors will be airdropped IVN for certain criteria's and in a highly unlike scenario where fund's hit maximum drawdown due to technical breakdown investors can expect the losses to be covered by the treasury which is locked to safeguard investin's key liquidity providers interests. 10% of IVN are locked as insurance for investor funds and as the total value under management grows this treasury will be replenished with a basket of different assets to protect all user's interests. IVN allocation and sales \u00b6 A total supply of 9,000,000 IVN tokens are minted with no further minting possible as the contract has no minting functionality. A total of 20% of tokens will be sold on binance smart chain and 10% will be used to add liquidity to AMM, since we dont have a significant backing we will be providing liquiidty for a indefinite time. We would be announcing more details on liquidity farming intiatives for protocol users soon. The token sale is priced at 1 BNB = 2400 IVN. The seed was raised at 0.12 USD per token and is vested over 3 years with a 8% scheduled release every quarter Core team's tokens are vested for 3 years with 8% scheduled release every quarter. The advisory tokens are unallocated at the moment and once advisors are onboarded the tokens would be vested for 1 year. The treasury is used to incentivize users and make them part owners of Investin, there will be scheduled airdrops to top performing funds, funds managing high aum consistently and to investors committed to building investin. In rare cases when a white-listed token gets hacked and fund performance crashes, the treasury will be used to compensate investor losses as it's investin's job to maintain rug proof tokens white listed that funds can trade on. Fund usage \u00b6 50% of the funds will be used to build the Investin protocol and perform upgrades to the existing architecture/UI, which includes team recruits and R&D on layer 2 solutions. 35% will be used to perform security upgrades and bug bounties. Investin being fund management protocol have to put fund security as its top priority. 15% will be kept in reserve to cope with any emergency or unexpected situations Governance \u00b6 We believe alignment between token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance. More explicitly, we believe IVN tokens are the vehicle to drive alignment and participation in the protocol. IVN token holders should be people who interact with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table. We expect token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation. For example, implementing new functionality, introducing changes to protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the IVN token holders for review.
