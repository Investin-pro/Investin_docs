The protocol shall ensure both the users are well incentivized to conduct a trustless exchange of offerings, while managers are given access to almost all possible market activities with the fund assets, investors are provided with best in class UI with safety standards built-in to protect capital at all costs. Make investment \u00b6 Solana Investors are required to interact with the Fund program and deposit in the base denomination of the fund, this amount is initially stored in the router vault and an investor account is created to identify each investment, essentially making unique investment receipts to handle each investment independently. FundInstruction::InvestorDeposit { amount } The investor receipt allows Investin protocol to provide features like: Enables investments to be composable and be used as a debt receipt for further use, including a custom performance claim by manager on investments that continue to stay active for longer periods. Investor stoploss i.e. investors can define the percentage of profit or loss at which they wish to withdraw. EVM Investors are required to interact with the router contract and give approval of the base token with which they would like to invest in any fund. After the approval investors can proceed to call the make investment function which mints an ERC 721 token and send it to the caller's address while transferring the said amount of approved tokens to the router. We use a different approach at solving the fund management system by using the ERC 721 standard to identify investors on blockchain. function makeInvestment(uint amount) external returns(uint256) IVNy token \u00b6 IVNy is a non-fungible token based on OpenZeppelin's ERC 721 standard, this token is used as a confirmation receipt that all investors shall receive on a successful investment transaction. The token holds no value and is merely used to identify investors of a particular fund. Beware the loss of access to the address holding IVNy token can result to loss of investment as contracts are hardcoded and only recognize investors through these non-fungible tokens. Advantages of using nft: Once minted investor can use the same token in the wallet to interact with the protocol at almost 40% less gas expense since the protocol will know details about the investor, token acts as a marker. We plan to integrate lending feature for IVNy nft holders i.e. investors can borrow by staking their IVNy token as collateral. Assets can be added to existing allocation in any fund and partial assets can be withdrawn as well Performance \u00b6 The performance on invested amount can be queried on-chain and the smart contracts use on-chain amm pool reserves to calculate asset price hence the performance will be subject to an error \u00b12% but upon ending investment the asset evaluation done by contracts will be final and true to the exact decimal at all times. Blockchain is open by design and any investor can query the fund address to keep tabs on performance. Solana the fund is a program derived address(PDA) Solidity function getInvestmentDetails(uint tokenId) external view returns (uint128 investedAmount, uint128 startPerformance, uint128 currentPerformance, uint128 currentReturns) End Investment \u00b6 Solana This instruction can only be called by investor address and consists of multiple transactions to overcome the current limitation of 35 accounts and 200,000 compute limit per transaction. To achieve the composablilty into Investin's architecute we handle the withdrawal process in multiple steps in each step the specific updates on investor account(receipt) is handled. There is no lockup period investors remain in full control of funds and can deposit/withdraw at their convenience. Example flow: A fund having position in 4 assets that are swapped from Raydium and 2 margin positions open on mango markets is handled in the following transaction flows: The investor share is calculated on the total fund AUM. The assets owed by fund are accounted in this stage. The dues on fund assets are settled and sent to investor wallet address The borrows are settled on both margin positions and according to investors' share, the positions are closed. Is is important to note here that the health of margin account remains same, only the margin amount is changed. The dues on margin positions are settled by withdrawing from mango account and sending directly to investor address Solidity This function can only be called by investor's holding IVNy token and consists of two sub-functions which gives investor's the option to either collect 100% of their investment or make a partial withdrawal to book profits on invested amount. The investors have the option to recieve their investment according to fund allocation which is the cheapest option to withdraw or they can provide the token in which they would like to get their investment withdrawn from fund. There is no lockup period investors remain in full control of funds and can deposit/withdraw at their convenience. Fees \u00b6 Management fee A 2% upfront management fee is deducted on each successful investment out of which 1% is given to the manager who uses the fees to manage expenses of running the fund which includes transferring tokens to fund contract and calling swap functions to trade using amm's. The management fee won't be deducted if the investor withdraws their investment before the manager moves tokens to their fund contract. Performance fee The managers can only collect their performance fee if they reach the minimum return on investment they set, this minimum ROI is range bound and can be anywhere between 5-50%. If the manager makes less than the ROI they set, the investors won't be charged any performance fee and can withdraw at any time. This system of reaching minimum ROI thereby only encourages managers to make more profits and creates a positive feedback loop. Miscellaneous \u00b6 Investors can withdraw funds from the router without incurring any fee if the withdrawal is done before the manager moves tokens to fund contract There is a possibility investment made to a fund hasnt been moved to fund contract which means the investment will be in an inactive state and no performance made by the relevant fund will be reflected on such investment.

IVN token represents ownership of the protocol and is designed to incentivize traders to run their funds and attract investments. Investin's most important stakeholders are its Managers/Traders Investin's growth is directly proportional to its user's success hence the tokeneconomics are deeply baked into making them the rightful owners of the protocol. The protocol captures an average 1.4% value of the total assets under management in fees on each successful cycle of manager meeting their set returns on investments and collecting performance fee. Hence manager's success in markets is directly proportional to the protocol's growth and to ensure the longevity of the relation, the total fee accrued by the protocol will be distributed among the managers who stake their IVN tokens Incentives for fund managers \u00b6 IVN Tokens will be used to incentivise fund managers who outperform their peers through our Performance Mining program. Managers who stay on top of the leaderboard across sucessive intervals will be eligible to earn IVN rewards which can be used to unlock additional pro features and also earn an additonal share of the protocol fees. Fee distribution \u00b6 Managers running funds on Investin and staking IVN tokens will capture a share of the accured protocol fee by staking IVN tokens in staking contract controlling the fee distribution pool. Make sure you stack enough IVN tokens to capture a bigger share! Unclaimed shares of the Protocol fee will be used to buyback IVN and burn. The burning will stop when 50% of tokens are burnt and in subsequent phases the fee would be added to top performing funds as additional returns. Performance mining \u00b6 Managers that top the leaderboards are rewarded through a performance mining program. A definite number of IVN tokens will be distributed everyday to encourage managers to maintain theor performance and also attract more traders to start funds, bringing in more users to the protocol. The mining rewards are distributed based on the following scoring system: \\[ Score(fund) = (\\frac{Perf_{fund}}{Perf_{max}}W_{perf}) + (\\frac{AUM_{fund}}{AUM_{max}}W_{aum}) + (\\frac{Nol_{fund}}{Nol_{fund}}W_{nol}) \\] Performance Assets under management Number of investors Perf max : highest fund performance relative to last epoch AUM max : highest AUM of fund Nol max : highest number of investor over all funds Perf fund : fund performance relative to last epoch AUM fund : current AUM of the fund Nol fund : current number of investors in the fund W perf : weightage assigned to performance W aum : weightage assigned to AUM W nol : weightage assigned to number of investors $$ W_{perf}: 60 points $$ $$ W_{aum}: 30 points $$ $$ W_{nol}: 10 points $$ As shown above, the score is a weighted average of the three charecterisitc metrics of each fund, normalised over the cuurent epoch with the following wieghtage: Performance: 60%, AUM: 30% and Number of investors: 10% . Fund managers qualifying witha score greater than the minimum threshold will be airdropped their respecttive IVN rewards at the end of each epoch (lasting 7 days) and the scores will be reset for the next epoch. For Investors \u00b6 Investors are expected to actively engage with protocol to find the best performing fund for their investments. Investors will be airdropped IVN based on various criterias as the protocol matures and in a highly unlikely scenario where a fund hits unexpected drawdown due to a technical breakdown investors can expect their losses to be covered by the treasury, safeguarding investin's key liquidity providers' interests. 10% of IVN are locked as insurance in the treasury vault and as the total value under management grows this treasury will be replenished with a basket of different assets to protect all user's interests. Token Utility \u00b6 IVN tokens locked in the staking contract will allow fund managers to unlock pro features, all the while earning a proportional share of the protocol fee. Following is a list of pro features that will be available for managers to use: Limit/stoploss orders Access greater than 2x leverage on margin accounts Access to governance portal to vote and submit proposals IVN allocation and sales \u00b6 A total supply of 9,000,000 IVN tokens are minted with no further minting possible as the contract has no minting functionality. Initial Liquidty for IVN tokens was sourced from the IDO ( Wault IDO ) and we have remained the major liquidity provider for IVN pools ever since. The project was bootstrapped by founders, hence the seed tokens remain unallocated. Tokens allocated to the core team are vested linearly for 3 years with a quarterly release schedule. contract address Half of the tokens allocated for Liquidity Mining were used to incentivize the native IVN LP Farming and the rest will be utilized in future LP farming programs. The advisory tokens are unallocated at the moment and once advisors are onboarded the tokens will be vested for period of 1 year. The treasury is used to incentivize users and make them part owners of Investin, there will be scheduled airdrops to top performing funds, funds managing high aum consistently and to investors committed to helping investin grow. In rare cases when a white-listed token pool gets manipulated and fund performance crashes, the treasury will be used to compensate investor losses as it's imperative for the protocol to maintain a rug-proof token white liste that funds can trade with. Fund usage \u00b6 50% of the funds will be used to build the Investin protocol and perform upgrades to the existing architecture/UI, which includes team recruits and R&D on future integrations. 35% will be used to perform security upgrades and offer bug bounties. Investin being an asset management protocol puts fund security as its top priority. 15% will be kept in reserve to cope with any emergency or unexpected situations Governance \u00b6 We believe alignment between token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance. More explicitly, we believe IVN tokens are the vehicle to drive alignment and participation in the protocol. IVN token holders should be people who interact with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table. We expect token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation. For example, implementing new functionality, introducing changes to protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the IVN token holders for review.
